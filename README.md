# Setting Up a React App with Separate API

This guide will walk you through setting up a React app with a separate API. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. **Install Main Dependencies**:
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the main directory folder of your project.
   - Run the following command to install the main project dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

2. **Set Up the API**:
   - After installing the main project dependencies, navigate to the `api` directory within your project.
   - Run the following command to install the API dependencies:

     ```bash
     cd api
     npm install
     ```

   - Once the dependencies are installed, start the API server:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **Start the React App**:
   - After setting up the API, return to the main project directory.
   - Start the React app in development mode:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   This will open your React app in your default web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

Now that your React app and API are running, you can start building and using your application. Customize the React app and the API according to your project requirements.
